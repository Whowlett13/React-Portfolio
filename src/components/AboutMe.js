                My name is
                <strong> Wyatt Howlett</strong>
                and I'm a <strong> FullStack Web Developer </strong> located in
                Montreal with a passion for creating elegant, efficient, and
                user-friendly websites and applications. I've been working as a
                developer for 1 year, and during that time, I've had the
                pleasure of working on a wide variety of projects for clients
                ranging from small startups to large corporations.
                <br></br>I specialize in{" "}
                <strong> Fullstack Web Development</strong> as well as
                <strong>Networking</strong>, and I'm always looking for new
                challenges that allow me to apply my skills and learn new
                things. I'm always striving to take on new projects that push me
                to grow and improve. In addition to my technical skills, I
                believe that a well-rounded developer is not only skilled in
                their craft, but also engaged with the world and the people
                around them.
